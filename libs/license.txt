1. The class structure and the classes themselves as they are included
   in the JAR file that comes with this distribution of the Spatial API must stay intact.
   It is not allowed to decompile the class-files and/or replace the orginal
   files with modified versions until this permission is explicitly granted
   by the author.
2. The JAR-file may be decompressed and the class-files may be stored in other 
   formats/JAR-files as long as 1.) is fulfilled. If Spatial API is distributed as part
   of another project, it is allowed to obfuscate the class-files together with
   the rest of the project-files if you feel that this is required to protect 
   your intellectual property. 
3. It is not required to mention the use of the Spatial API in your project, albeit it would
   be nice doing so. If you do, it is required to mention the Augmented Technologies webpage
